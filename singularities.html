			<hr/>
			<p>This Minecraft mod is an addon for <a href="http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1293528" rel="nofollow">AOBD</a>, it adds singularities for <a href="https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/aobd-singularities/projects/avaritia" rel="nofollow">Avaritia</a>.</p>
			<p>Avaritia adds a couple of singularities for ores that are commonly found in most mods and there are also a couple of addon mods that add more singularities to avaritia. But somehow I didn't think that was enough and made this mod.</p>
			<p>This mod is heavily based on <a href="http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/2472300" rel="nofollow">AOBD berry bushes</a>.</p>
			<p>This mod does not make mods such as <a href="https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/aobd-singularities/projects/thermal-singularities" rel="nofollow">Thermal singularities</a> or <a href="https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/aobd-singularities/projects/universal-singularities" rel="nofollow">Universal singularities</a> obsolete. This mod can only add singularities for materials that have an ore form and an ingot form, and those mods add singularities for things like coal or enderium, which is something this mod will never do.</p>
