			<p>Paileology, the study of buckets.</p>
			<p>This Minecraft mod simply adds buckets made out of various materials such as: wood, leather, glass and gold. Wooden buckets can only pick up cold liquids such as water and glass buckets will break after placing a hot liquid such as lava.</p>
			<p>The buckets added by this mod are able to pick up liquids from practically any mod so you might never even need iron buckets anymore.</p>
			<p>It's also fully configurable which means that you can add and remove buckets to your heart's content.</p>
